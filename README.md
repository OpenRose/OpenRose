## OpenRose Documentation Wiki

Please refer to ![OpenRose Wiki](https://github.com/OpenRose/OpenRose/wiki) for documentation. 

## Purpose

OpenRose is developed with focus on ease of defining, maintaining, sharing and reporting on different types of Requirements (also known as Itemz).

Organized and Bundled Requirements could lead to

- Requirements Specification
- Contract Document
- Needs and Wants Specification
- Detailed specification for AI (Artificial Intelligence) processing
- List of Activities
- Standard Specification
- Journal on Specific Topic
- Rule Book
- Cook Book
- Nicely described Life Memories in a Specific Order (Personal Notes)
- Research report and findings

BUT primarily, **Itemz** is nothing but Requirements / Needs / Wants / Notes / Findings / Quesitons / Tests.
